It supports SQL Server 2005...2025 including Local DB.


# UI Highlights

*  Sql syntax highlighter,
*  Light and dark theme support,
*  Metrics sorting,
*  Database filter,
*  Columns chooser.


## Installation

```

## Example
```
$report = "$($ENV:SYSTEM_ARTIFACTSDIRECTORY)\Reports\{InstanceName} {Version} on {Platform}"
SqlServer.AdministrativeViews -o $report -all

# or 

$report = "$($ENV:GITHUB_TEMP)\Reports\{InstanceName} {Version} on {Platform}"
dotnet dnx SqlServer.AdministrativeViews -o $report -all
```

GITHUB_TEMP and SYSTEM_ARTIFACTSDIRECTORY are directories that are emptied at the beginning and end of each job on github actions and azure devops.
